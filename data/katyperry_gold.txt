This is an absolutely heartless response. There aren’t even politics involved. Just good American families losing their homes as you tweet, evacuating into shelters. https://t.co/DJ4PN26bLZ
Love you too friend ❤️ Onward and upward 👩‍❤️‍👩 https://t.co/tYl4ueBjB5
When we started Idol last year, @LukeBryanOnline, @LionelRichie, and I wondered if there were any 💎 left in the rough. We continue to be blown away with the talent. We are so excited to share these new 🌟with you when @AmericanIdol returns to @ABCNetwork for Season ✌🏻on March 3! https://t.co/M4fhw6nre3

I love seeing my bb’s from season 1 passing on their #AmericanIdol knowledge 🧠 on to the contestants in season 2 🤝 First @lainehardymusic now @GabbyBarrett_ it’s all about paying it forward... ❤
One of my fav things about #AmericanIdol is that we go to them. We dig to find our diamonds. #LetsDoThis #FamilyTime #Snacks #ILoveMyJob 💎
My favorite part of watching #americanidol with my boyfriend is that he always tries to ask if they got in or not before we give the final vote. I never tell him hahahahahahahahahahaha
That’s the 3rd straight Sunday in a row I’ve cried thanks to #AmericanIdol. Let’s do it all again tomorrow, same time, same place, for the last day of auditions... who’s left to find???
THE FINAL COUNTDOWN!!! HOW MANY MORE DIAMONDS CAN AMERICA DIG UP⁉ #americanidol
